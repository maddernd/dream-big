## **Windows 11 Installation instructions**

What we cover in this Windows Installation Instruction

- [x] Chocolatey (Recommended)
- [x] Node.Js 16.16.0
- [x] Angular
- [x] Git
- [x] Docker
- [x] Windows Subsystem for Linux

Installation steps:

- Install chocolatey (Highly Recommended)
    
    It is optional to install the chocolatey package manager but highly recommended since it is very useful for installing various software packages such as Python and Node.Js(Which we will be Chocolatey to install) on Windows systems. 
    
    To install Chocolatey, [click here][win-1] and follow the instructions. 
    
- Install Node.Js

    If you have Chocolatey installed, type in the following command: `choco install nodejs --version=16.16.0` in PowerShell with administrator mode and then hit enter to proceed with Node.Js installation. Be sure to have Node.Js uninstalled beforehand. Restart your command prompt and run `node -v` to verify the download version. You should have the following line `v16.16.0` for a successful download.

    For people who didn't have chocolatey installed or cannot run the command, click this [link][win-2] and install the one suitable for your device. If the link above doesn't work, please navigate to [Node.Js’s official website][win-3], click "Other Downloads" and then select "All download options". There should be a list of download options, click “../” option on the top to view more versions. After installing 16.16.0, restart your command prompt and run `node -v` to verify the download version. You should have the following line `v16.16.0` for a successful download.

- Install Git

    If you have chocolatey installed, run the command: `choco install git.install` in PowerShell with administrator mode to get the newest version of git. Restart your command prompt and run `git --version` to verify the installation.

    For people who didn't have chocolatey installed or cannot run the command, install git from [here][win-4]. Scroll down windows and click the hyperlink to download the Git installer. After installation, restart your command prompt and run `git --version` or `git -v` to verify the installation.

- Create Dream Big folder and clone git repo

    Once Node.Js has been installed, create a folder for where you want the DreamBig project to be stored. Open a terminal window at that location then type in and run `git clone https://github.com/maddernd/dream-big`. The DreamBig project should now be copied into the folder you created earlier, open this folder in Visual Code or other code editors of your choice.

- Install Angular

    Navigate a terminal to where the dream-big directory is, then type in and run `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`, this will install Angular globally onto your system.

- Run Angular server

    Navigate your terminal to dream-big\dream-big-ui and then enter `npx ng serve`, this should start a local development server on your machine which you can use to see how the project is coming along, a few messages will appear and then one like this should show near the bottom: `Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/`
    
    Open your browser to the address referenced by your terminal, this will allow you to see what the project looks like in its current state, if you make changes to the project and then save it, the browser should update the contents of the page depending on the changes you have made.

- Install Docker

    *This step may take a while, do not shut down your device.*

    If you have chocolatey installed, run the command `choco install docker-desktop` to download docker. Run the Docker application to verify the download.

    For people who didn't have chocolatey installed or cannot run the command, please navigate to the [Docker website][win-5], select the suitable one for your device, and download the installer. Run the Docker application to verify the download.

- Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

    *This step may take a while, do not shut down your device.*

    Docker application requires a Linux environment to run. WSL is the best option for windows machines. Open PowerShell, and use the command `wsl --list --online` to view all the available versions of the Linux system. Select your preferred one and download it with `wsl --install -d <name of the machine>`. For example, if you wish to install Ubuntu, just type `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`. 

    If it is your first-time downloading WSL, you might have to enable some features. You can navigate to  “*Control Panel*” => “*Programs*” => “*Programs and Features*” => “*Turn Windows features on or off*”, and find “*Virtual Machine Platform*” and "*Windows Subsystem for Linux*”. Turn both of them on and restart your machine.

    *Note: The WSL features clash with some virtual machine programs and sometimes consume memory. Please consider turning the features off when you don't need them.*

    If you have WSL installed previously, Docker may ask you to upgrade it with a pop-up window. Follow this [link][win-6] to download an update packet. Find the suitable one for your machine and run the downloaded file locally to install the update. 

    Run the application for your just downloaded Linux machine, and follow the prompts to create a new user. Now you can run your Docker application to verify, if there’s no error message showing then you should have your WSL installed successfully.

- Run docker container

    Open a terminal window and navigate to the root folder of the DreamBig project, enter and run the following line `docker compose up`, this will create a docker container that simulates the backend of the project, you can now also start this container by going directly to the Docker GUI program and run the dream-big container in the **Containers/Applications** tab on the left.
